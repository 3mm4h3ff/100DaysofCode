## Python for Everybody - Full Course with Dr. Chuck
### Youtube 14 hour python course: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DvywoWv6fI

#### Why program?
- Computers are built to do things for us.
- Give instructions to computer devices to do, ie. a mobile to know to take or make calls etc.
- Computers are very literal, we have to be very percise. 

#### Hardware Architecture
- Explanation of each type of computer hardware. 

#### Installing Python 3 on Windows
- Windows Bad - skipped over.

#### Installing Python 3 on Mac
- Mac Bad - skipped over.

### Chapter 1:
- Elements of a Python story: 
	- Vocabulary / Words == Variables and Reserved words
![Reserved Words](/freecodecamp/images/reservedwords.jpeg)
	- Sentence stucture == valid syntax patterns. Example: 
		```
		x = 2 <- Assignment statement
		x = x + 2 <- Assignment with expression
		print(x) <- Print statement

	x is a variable | = is an operator | 2 is a constant | print() is a reserved word
		```

	- Story stucture == constructing a program for a purpose 
		- Interactive: You type directly to Pythone one line at a time and it responds
		- Script: You enter a sequence of statements (ie. lines) into a file using a text editor (cough _Vim_) and tell Python to execute.
		- Steps: 
	</br>	
		1. Like a recipe, a program needs to be in a sequence of order.
		2. Some steps are conditional and may be skipped.
		3. Sometimes a step is repeated.
		4. Sometimes we store a set of steps to be used over and over as they may be needed throughout the program.
